# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! Built with **TypeScript** and grounded in **functional programming** and **immutability**.

---

## ⚡ Why Bun?

This project uses **Bun**, a fast JavaScript runtime ideal for Advent of Code:

- **Tail Call Optimization (TCO)**: Enables deep recursion without stack overflow.
- **High Performance**: Optimized JIT for complex Advent of Code computations.
- **Built-In Test Runner**: Allows easy test setup and validation of solutions.
- **Native TypeScript Support**: Type-safe coding without extra compilation.
